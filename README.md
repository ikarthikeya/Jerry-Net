# **Jerry-Net: LEO Satellite Communication Protocol**

### **Project Description**

This repository contains the initial stages of development for a custom **peer-to-peer network protocol** designed to operate within the context of **Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations**, such as **Starlink** or **OneWeb**. The protocol aims to address the challenges of communication over satellite networks, specifically in terms of Inter-Satellite Link (ISL) and handover delays, using a robust, scalable approach that enhances performance for various use cases, including vehicular mobility, remote exploration, and underwater search and rescue.

### **Use Case and Objective**

We are focusing on building a protocol that facilitates:

- **Realistic emulations of LEO communication channels**.
- Handling **simultaneous parallel connections** from earth-based data sources to at least five satellite devices.
- Demonstrating and mitigating key satellite communication challenges, such as ISL and handover delays, while incorporating **hybrid wired-satellite communication**.

The protocol will be implemented and demonstrated using **Raspberry Pi (RPi)** devices, but the system should be able to scale to other platforms as needed.
